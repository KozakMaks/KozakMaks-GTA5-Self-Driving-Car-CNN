*Images are at 2x speed to show more driving in a shorter time span.*

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [Sentdex/pygta5](https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5).  
The aim was to create a slightly more realistic GTA5 self-driving car. By utilizing imitation learning, the model has learned to stay in lane and maintain its speed.

## The Model

*Drawing*

This model was trained using approximately 80,000 images with corresponding steering and throttle commands. The architecture was loosely modeled after [PilotNet by NVIDIA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316). However, the network was modified to add two regression headsâ€”one for steering and one for throttle. Initially, the model was trained using only the steering command to learn robust convolutional features. Later, a second regression head was added and only the remaining regression layers were trained to complete the full model.

## Datasets

Two separate datasets were used for steering and throttle because the distribution for each heavily favored certain positions. The data was pruned to create a flatter distribution, preventing the model from overfitting. When one dataset had a balanced distribution, the other did not, hence the separate processing.

## Usage

*Recommended to use dual monitors.*

1. **Download Model Weights:**  
   Download the model weights from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NgaGZ-oFjvl-GxJvOtqXdIedrumV64-o) and place them in the same directory as `GTA_SelfDrivingCar.py`.

2. **Launch GTA5:**  
   Run GTA5 in windowed mode at a resolution of 1280x720.

3. **Prepare the Environment:**  
   Find a car and enable the Hood Camera (press `8`).

4. **Run the Self-Driving Script:**  
   Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python GTA_Self_Driving_Car.py
5.**CNN**
